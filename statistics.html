								<h3>Total Corporations</h3>
								<p>The original leaderboard, which existed as an ethereally-sourced list in HSO #white-stars, contained only 25 coporations. V5.0, posted in Novemember 2020, was the last of its kind. My early records of v6 were not great, however I began in January 2021 with around 100 corporations, and by v6.9 in August 2021 this had grown to just over 300. As of v7.0, records are far more reliable, and here below is the growth in the total number of corporations since. Also on file are the scores for each corporation at the conclusion of each cycle, however I am yet to find a convenient way to make this accessible.</p>

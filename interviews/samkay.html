							<h1>SamKay</h1>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> SamKay, thank you so much for agreeing to be our first interviewee! Legion/The Collective has been top of the leaderboard since I took over in early 2021, so you were the obvious first choice.<br>
							So first things first, how long have you played HS? And were you in any corporations before The Collective?</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>SamKay:</b> I first downloaded HS back in 2017. After a brief pause reaching RS7, something compelled me to come back in 2019.<br>
							I joined a mainly British corp. But I very quickly upgraded mods & surpassed my old colleagues. I realised I had to join a more competitive, super-focused corp. Legion started opening up seats and after a teeth grinding 3-day interview, they granted me access and I've never looked back since.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> I bet they haven't regretted their choice either! So after years of White Stars, what has been the biggest highlight from your WS career?</p>
							<p><b>SamKay:</b> Yes, it's true. I am mainly a WS player. And I much prefer commanding a team. A team is only as good as its leaders and vice versa. Several highlights include all WS playing against BSO, SystemShock, StarControl, Dadcorp. I know when we match these bad boys, I'm in it for a tough yet fun week. And my team always matches my hardened spirit that week. The big highlight....... when Hitman and I led Legion against TTL (led by Kierrip). Oooof...what a week 😅</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> I think we all have a love-hate relationship with those tough matches. And what has been your favourite meta or tactic in WS?</p>
							<p><b>SamKay:</b> I gotta say, the recent psuedo-drone wars has really piqued my interest in this game. But the old Delta/Bond/Leap meta.....while it was fun to say the least, it slowly pulled me to chronic fatigue. Same thing applied to the Suppress/Delta Rocket meta. My best period was during the summer of 2021. I strove to get The Collective beyond usual standards by specialising 30+ players. Mining, loading, defense and 2 types of offense. It took a while, lots of grit, arguments and intrinsic motivation. But it has paid off.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> No doubt. I studied one of your replays against BSO, I watched through 3 times just studying your miners! What do you think is the number one thing that has made The Collective so successful?</p>
							<p><b>SamKay:</b> I'm so tempted to say we had some of the funniest and nerdiest strategists in the game. However, it's the individual Collective efforts. Each of us has brought something to the table. And the rest of us were only so happy to listen and apply. A successful corp doesn't just come from winning matches & events. It comes from multiple personalities, working in sync towards bettering long-term corp values and goals.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Couldn't agree more. Now if you could pass on one gem of wisdom to new commanders or First Officers, what would it be?</p>
							<p><b>SamKay:</b> Hmmm.... 1 gem? Impossible. Here I go...<br>
							• To WS commanders - There's no glory to be had by simply "leading". It takes a special individual to listen to strategy ideas, counter argue, manage a plethora of verbal diarrhoea during the 5 days, and to mould a consensus.<br>
							• To FOs - only lead a server/corp if you have the real-life time, energy and true dedication. This is a voluntary job. And you won't get the gratitude you want or deserve. You do it because you want to. That's that. Cold, perfunctory and hard fact. But … there's something to be said about a glamorous position. It comes with responsibility. And an attitude to be a servant leader. Surround yourself with officers who think like you and who have guts to challenge you.<br>
							• Recognise a problem before it becomes a problem.<br>
							• Listen, learn, apply, improvise, sharpen and above all....L.I.S.T.E.N.<br>
							• Establish well-set boundaries to manage your beautiful life.<br>
							• Start knowing the difference between loyalty and integrity. Get rid of the "my way or the highway attitude". I personally have no space for people like this<br>
							• Own your f**king mistakes<br>
							• By the way … it's also lonely at the top. So, if you take the FO job seriously, it will shape you to be a better leader in society.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Great advice, I'm glad you didn't limit yourself to just one thing! So do you play any games outside of HS?</p>
							<p><b>SamKay:</b> Another game??? ARE YOU INSANE. I BARELY HAVE TIME TO PLAY THIS ONE 😂😂</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Haha fair enough, how about any other hobbies or interests? What's life like for SamKay AFK?
							<p><b>SamKay:</b> I'm an avid cat-lover. Love those little tykes. If money is no object, I would probably own a cat zoo 🤣 <br>
							I'm also into wellness cuisines. DM me if you want to hear more.<br>
							I travel a lot, due to work. Too much for my suffering. But in the process, I started a relationship with BeetleJuice. Totally unexpected.  And we are going stronger since. Watch this space.<br>
							I'm a nuclear strategist in real life. That means I have to subject myself to nerdy scientists, greedy lobbyists and politicians. Fun, fun, fun for a female in a very male-dominated industry.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> I'm not much of a cat person, but a nuclear strategist, wow!<br>
							I greatly appreciate your time, sharing your thoughts on the game and what it takes to be number 1. And hopefully all our wonderful new readers enjoyed this too! Best of luck in the future of Hades, cats, relationships, and not letting the world blow up.</p>

	$v = "**G’day Ahlims, great to chat with you. Standard introduction, how long have you played HS? And were you in any corporations before Yishun?
	;;
	I genuinely don't know and can't google or remember exactly when I started playing HS but I joined discord Feb 2018 and my first interactions with discord were purely HS and with YishunCC. I might have been with a Singaporean starter corp before being redirected to YishunCC. We have mostly been a small independent corporation with its fair share of mergers and allies.
	;;
	**And over that time, any major highlights from your WS career? What has been your favourite period or meta in WS?
	;;
	There have been countless highlights and memorable moments as far as I can remember. From getting my first WS distinction around season 8-9 to running back to back ws for a period of a year odd. I would say my favourite WS era was when most players were mid game and WS was yet to be dominated by a few modules. Getting matched against an opponent of similar calibre was the norm. You never know how the ws would end until the last few hours. Games were closely fought and open.
	
	I can't say whether I like the current and past metas but I have come to adapt to them because they just work.
	;;
	**That’s true, as the meme goes: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome. You have more WS games under your belt than anyone I'm aware of. Do you have any particular goals in HS or, or just enjoy playing week after week?
	;;
	As with most games when starting out, there were lofty dreams to top all charts, complete all possible achievements. But with time I knew what I was good at and what I enjoyed, it became less of a thing. I won't deny that WS distinction came to my mind the times when the opportunity presented itself. I would make a run for it as long as it did not compromise the WS I was playing in.
	
	I particularly enjoy formulating plans on the go to exploit a window to win/seal/comeback in a ws. Pulling off well coordinated moves with several teammates to thwart moves by opponents or unlock a stubborn defence also brings a lot of satisfaction.
	
	Currently, I intend to reach an arbitrary number of WS or when I become jaded before calling it a day.
	;;
	**I definitely agree that those episodes of teamwork tactics to turn a game are definitely the most satisfying. Now I understand you've run a lot of WS outside your home corp, do you find that useful for learning new things? Or is it just for some variety?
	;;
	I have guested with around 8-10 corps in the past year. Previously I have mainly run ws in YishunCC. I would say that when guesting WS, at best it is a way to interact with the HS community at large and to experience how things run at different corps. At worst it is seen as an abandonment of your home corp and or they don't have the means to run the type of ws preferred.
	
	Personally I have experienced 3-4 general strategies that corps would deploy for WS, the difference between corps lies in the degree of heavy handedness from WS commanders if any.
	;;
	**It’s tough when your home corp (however temporarily) can’t provide what you want each week, so long as your corp mates understand, I personally think it’s fine. More broadly, what advice can you give players, new or old, to refine their WS tactics?
	;;
	There is no shame in imitation. Whenever you lose to a stronger opponent, understand why you lost. Evaluate and adopt the relevant parts of their tactics and tweak it to your own. It usually takes some trial and error to understand your strengths and configuration. I have also honed my tactics mostly through losses and accumulated experience.
	
	Understand the role you play in WS and actively look to contribute by way of communication and discussion with your corp mates. Keep in mind the mistakes made in prior WS and try to reduce them in the future.
	
	Ultimately I believe it's all about reading the flow of the WS and guessing the intent of the opponent.
	;;
	**And finally, the usual final question: what games and hobbies do you enjoy outside of HS?
	;;
	Outside of HS, I do play some PC games like Factorio, RimWorld, and Don't Starve Together.
	
	In parting, be kind to everyone and I wish all of you well.
	;;
	**Sage advice. Thanks for your time and sharing your wisdom! Cheers.";

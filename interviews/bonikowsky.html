							<under>Interviewed on 25<sup>th</sup> September 2022</under>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> G’day Bonikowsky, thank you for taking the time to chat with me. We’ve known each other in game a fair while, but how long ago did HS all start for you? Were you in any other corporations before OntarioDynasty?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> I started sometime in late 2018, coming up on 4 years ago. On day one I asked in global chat for a good corp and someone from the OntarioDynasty family invited me to join one of the training corps. I've been with the family ever since. Great people there.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Oh nice! It must be a great place if you’ve never left. Thinking back over that time, what has been your favourite meta-strategy in WS? And have there been any memorable highlights from your WS career?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> This might get a bit technical for some, but the golden days for me were long ago when we'd put together these awe-inspiring multiple-stage leap attacks. I wish I could remember which corp we were playing at the time, but I vividly remember the moment when the idea of leaping to a ship that was leaping forward clicked in my mind. You could time the landings of ships and often 4 or 5 miners with crunch in such a way that you could stagger attackers all around an area of the map and take over a planet. Super fun to plan and more fun to pull off.<br>
							One of the highlight matches for me was one time we matched Legion. They were way, way out of our league in tech and skill, so we decided to just have fun and we ended up using a recoil to leap the entire team -- 15 battleships and 15 miners -- deep into their side of the map, landing in 5 or 6 different sectors. Of course our whole team got wiped almost immediately, but we managed to kill a few ships and destroy a bunch of hydro 😂</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Wow, sounds like you made the most of that match! And I remember the first time I played against OntarioDynasty, you executed one of those multi-stage-leap-crunch plays, crossed 3 sectors to get to our P10 and wiped it out. I stayed up until 2am trying to help defend but we couldn’t stop it!</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> Ooh I remember that match well. It was an extremely close one. Our discord chat was on fire for hours on end as we tried to deal with the counter-play on that P10. I think I disbanded a transport at 4am. Was definitely another highlight for me, but I remember we all agreed we hoped for a break before our next fight with y’all.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Absolutely those were our thoughts too. Changing gears completely now, you’re one of the founders of Drone Wars, which has really established itself as a popular arcade/custom mode, but now alpha drones are strong in the current meta in their own right. Do you think the drone-meta will last?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> I had always thought the idea of just going crazy with a ton of drones would make for an interesting mini game. Then when relic drones were added to the game, I felt like we'd been gifted the last piece of the puzzle to make something like that work. It took a few iterations to refine some interesting rules to work with, but we eventually came up with something fun enough for us to fill two teams with. I never expected alpha drones to ever expand past us into the meta, but when pets were removed it turned out they actually had a place. I don't really think drone wars had much to do with that shift though, other than maybe speeding the change up slightly. As for the future meta, I couldn't say, but with Dark Nebula there are a lot more drones being added. They'll be around, but I don't think things will look at all like they do currently because you won't be able to just spam them quickly.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Just when I get AD to a respectable level too… What do you think is the number one thing that has made Drone Wars successful?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> The fact that it is by nature asynchronous. It took off because people were tired of the twitchy reactions needed in the fast speed pet reset meta.<br>
							Also, it provides cool screenshots.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Yeah I hear you. Well I’m sure many out there are grateful for giving them a fun change of pace. So you mentioned Dark Nebula before, what do you think or hope Dark Nebula will be like?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> I'm optimistic that it'll provide, like the dev has promised, more variety in playstyles. I'm a big fan of weakening mods that you pretty much have to use on every ship currently.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Yeah I hope so too - a singular “best” play-style does get a bit boring after a while. If you could pass on one gem of wisdom to new players or commanders, what would it be?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> Remember this is no more than a game, and that games are always more enjoyable when everyone has fun.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Couldn’t agree more. And finally, what games/hobbies do you play/have outside of HS?</p>
							<p><b>Bonikowsky:</b> In real life I'm a pastor and absolutely love what I do. My two daughters are the most entertaining part of my life, and on weekends I like to go online to play Halo Infinite with my brothers, reliving the halo splitscreen days from when we were young.</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Fantastic! Definitely have that game-life balance there. I can’t wait for Halo Infinite to finally bring out multiplayer co-op! Splitscreen Halo was a lot of my youth too 😁<br>
							Well thank you again for your time, hopefully everyone has enjoyed your perspectives as much as I have.</p>

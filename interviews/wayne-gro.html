							<under>Interviewed on 8<sup>th</sup> November 2022</under>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to chat. To start with, how long have you played HS, and what, if any, corporations were you in before BlackStar Order?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> I downloaded the app in February of 2018.  I was looking for a game similar to the old BBS door game, Tradewars 2002.  This was the first one to pop up when I did my search, I downloaded it, and was instantly hooked.
							<br>
							My first corp that I joined was B.E.E.R.  After playing with them for about 6 months or so, quite a few of us were looking to jump to a more active corp, and BSO was the first choice for all of us.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Yeah nice. Now jumping straight into the deep end. BSO is arguably the most successful corporation ever (RS Events, individual leaderboards, etc), and one of the most feared White Star competitors. Despite the strength of other corporations during that time, BSO was I believe the only top-tier team running 15 player competitive teams every single week. So the question is, how did you achieve such high tempo and consistency?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> That is jumping into the deep end, lol.  The main reason is BSO had most of the late game players locked up, either with outright membership, or running as allies in our queue system.
							<br>
							Running a conglomerate takes a lot of coordination.  We were very fortunate and had quite a few talented bot developers and a data analysis team that simplified things by quite a lot.  Our events, for example, were integrated completely with our RS queue system.  So we gathered data from each event, and benchmarks during each one, and in real time we had accurate forecasting on who was doing what, and where they were going to place.   Having so many late game players (RS11, 10, 9) reduced an event to motivating everyone into playing as much as possible (and community culture really helped here), and then just pointing runs to the needed spots to guide the event as we desired.
							<br>
							Our WS success has had its own story as well.  We went from one of the top tier teams, to a bad joke of a team, to a very dominant team.  The original success was coordination back in the old turtle meta days.  The game changed and unfortunately, we did not adapt as well and we had a long decline.  We did a complete retooling of our competitive WS situation, leveraged our large late game player base that were willing to step up and go for number one, and put winning as our only goal.  I think we were really successful in the end.  In a year and a half time, our top tier team only lost 3 times, it is an achievement that I am very proud of.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Wow, that’s really interesting how you run the RS events, and how that experience for players paid dividends for your White Star teams. So next, it seems to me that in the past 6 months or so many corporations have "slacked off" so to speak, but thankfully some are starting to get back into it again. Do you think this applies to BSO a bit too? And what do you think the main drivers of this are?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> Yes, for sure.  The problem is (unfortunately) Andreas.  A lot of us have serious concerns about the future of HS (namely Dark Nebula), and it seems that anytime we have tried to raise those concerns we are either ridiculed by the developer, or ignored.  There are some issues with HS, but we don’t necessarily think that it needs a ground-up change from what we see as a successful game.  We have been playing this mobile game for years, when the retention period of mobile games is measured in weeks.  That says something about what makes HS special.
							<br>
							It appears that development of HS stalled when Battleship Apollo was being developed.  Unfortunately, BA just was not that great of a game.  It was made to appeal to the typical HS player, but it had no part of HS that we all love.  After BA folded, it seems that Andreas wants to do a full rebuild of HS instead of just adding new content.  Is that the right call?  I don’t know, honestly.
							<br>
							Don’t get me wrong, I fully understand that ultimately, HS needs to generate revenue in order to continue to run.  I get that.  A lot of the community feels that a few things could have been changed or added without the uncertainty of DN.  It’s hard to accept that HS will go away and whatever DN is going to be will take its place.  It is that uncertainty that has led to the vast community being in a holding pattern.  A lot of us are holding our breath and hoping that we still like this new game we will eventually get.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> And I know many players who share those sentiments. I try to stay optimistic that the current form of DN is really just a testing ground, and that the eventual DN will really just be reskinned HS plus any new content and associated mechanics adjustments that made it through the testing gauntlet. But I guess we all have to wait and see.
							<br>
							There's many advantages to large alliances and mega-corps, even just specific to WS. Do you think the developers will encourage this more, for the good of the game? Or would you like to see more smaller corporations grow themselves from grass roots to eventually compete at the highest level?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> Wow, that's a hard question for me to answer lol.  All things aside, I think that large guilds offer a lot of benefits that smaller groups have a hard time matching.  The biggest things in a game like HS is RS queues and WS teams.  Smaller groups have a harder time filling queues up, or having full teams for WS.  BSO, for example, has a huge queue system and full runs happen very often.  It is the same situation for WS teams…. With so many teams there is always a spot for anyone who wants to play WS, at whatever level they are interested in.  Sure, you might have a random smaller group that will be competitive at a particular facet of the game, but the large groups have a huge advantage here when they can provide services at whatever level the player wants.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Now part of the reason I wanted to interview you now, aside from the above, is that I heard you recently retired (to some extent). So firstly, congratulations, it's a relief I'm sure, and no doubt you'll stay connected to the game in many different ways. Looking back over the past almost 5 years, what have been some of your biggest highlights from your HS career? And what has been your favourite WS meta or strategy?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> Unfortunately I am one of those players that are in a holding pattern for DN.  I try to log in daily, run my shipments, and keep research going…. It is difficult to stay engaged when just about all blueprints are filled, most tech is at level 12, there is nothing left to build out in the main system, and life is busy :D. It is not fair for a group like BSO to have a part time leader, so I stepped back (for now) and I am happy to let others step in and lead things.  Hopefully DN is a hit, and I get that spark back.
							<br>
							Looking back on my run, I am most proud of the growth that BSO has had.  When I took the reins, our server was just over 1000 users, our RS queue was only for members, and membership was around 60 people.  In the time I ran things, we grew our server to over 2600 members, membership around the 200 mark, and over 600 allies to RS with.  We outright won RS events 6-14, helped a lot of guys get their Emperor rank, and had a top tier rated WS team for a year and a half.
							<br>
							My favorite part of WS was the bond/leap era, before the maps got nerfed into this mess that we have now.  It allowed dynamic strategy on the fly, and was a lot of fun.  Yes, you needed to have eyes on the map all of the time, but we did it for a very long duration with an international team that still allowed us to sleep at night.    I really miss using a cerb on a stick…. I have seen so many support ships get wrecked by an INT that got shoved past their barriers.  That is probably my favorite WS move to be honest.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Haha yeah interceptor-on-a-stick was brutal for those without suppress at the ready. As well as being FO, am I right that you were a regular commander of the top BSO teams? What qualities do you think make a successful commander?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> I have commanded and been commanded.  The most important thing to remember is you have to know your people.  Not everyone is dependable all of the time, and most people have lives outside of this game.  There was never a good reason to yell and rip anyone’s heads off… when mistakes were made, either you learned from them (we have channels and channels devoted to this), or you figure that player just is not a good fit for a top tier team and they need to be stepped down.  Eventually you will get a great crew together, and good people make success easy.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> Couldn’t agree more, and great that you managed to hold on to some game-life balance. And finally, especially with some new found time on your hands, what other interests or hobbies do you have outside of HS?
							</p>
							<p><b>Wayne-Gro:</b> I am a full time dad to my two boys.  Both of them are involved with sports, in the fall I help coach my oldest son’s Football (American) team, and in the spring I help coach their baseball teams.  When I am not doing that, I am dealing with my 3D printer farm for my side hustle business.  It’s always busy busy busy around my household.
							</p>
							<p><b>Timmeh:</b> That’s great to hear, the time will fly I’m sure. Well, thank you again for your time, those were some really fascinating insights that hopefully people found interesting. Cheers.

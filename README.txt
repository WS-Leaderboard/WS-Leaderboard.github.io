This website is based on a discord server (invite: https://discord.gg/p588eHaFqh) dedicated to rating and ranking Corporations from the game Hades Star in their White Star match results over time.

The website is based on an HTML5 UP template: Phantom. Details are below.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.
